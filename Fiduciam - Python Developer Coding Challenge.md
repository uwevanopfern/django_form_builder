Fiduciam Python Developer Coding Challenge

Thank you for applying for the Software Developer role at Fiduciam! Below is a coding challenge that we use to get a rough estimate of how comfortable you are with Python and Django, don't worry, there are lots of other factors that go into making a good developer so this is not the only thing that will be assessed!

Your task is to create a simple Django app that allows users to provide information about their favourite foods through online forms which are then saved in the database, the workflow will look like so:

1. Forms are created by admin users and assigned to client users
2. These forms are then accessed by the clients (and no-one else)
3. Clients then fill out these forms to provide data, the data should be persistent so if they save at any time, they will be able to log back into the website and see the same data
4. Admin users should be able to see the data that the clients have provided

Forms should collect the following data from the clients:

1. Name
2. Email
3. Telephone
4. Profile Picture
5. Date of birth
6. Favourite food


Things to think about:
1. Account security and password constraints
2. Ensuring that only the appropriate people can see the data (a client shouldn't be able to see another client's data, however an admin should be able to see all data)
3. Validating form data (e.g. email must contain a @ symbol, telephone can't be 2 digits long...etc.)
5. How are users created? (It is fine to create these users from the Django admin panel)
6. Can any user information be prefilled into the forms to make their lives easier? (e.g. name)
7. Testing would be nice to ensure that future implementations don't break any existing functionalities


Please send your project (as a zip file) to administrator@fiduciam.co.uk. It should take around 2-3 hours to complete.

Good luck!
